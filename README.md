# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

# Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

  I first ran an overall rspec to see where my errors would be. I then worked file by file starting with facility, moving into DMV, and then vehicle. I started with the first failure, fixed what was failing, and moved on to the next one. Overall it was fairly quick, which was a relief cause I was expecting it to be a handful.

  # What was hard about working with code you did not write?

  Personally for me, I don't have a lot of experience with working with hashes so I had to figure out how to "decode" the hash, but once I got that figured out, it was pretty easy going and I was able to pick up what the code was doing relatively easily and move forward from there.

  # What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

  Like I said in the first response, the lessons we've had on debugging combined with things like the IC and jungle beats, I feel like I've gotten much better at recognizing patterns in the code and understanding what each method is trying to do, which makes it a lot easier to figure out why I'm getting the errors that I get.
